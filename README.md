## Project Overview
This project is based on [flutter-chat-demo](https://github.com/duytq94/flutter-chat-demo) by Duy Tran. ChatterBox is a messaging app with the following features:
- Chat messaging
- Stories
- Edited user profile

The main improvement made from Duy's original project is the enhancement of the core messaging functionality, including a more robust client-to-client communication.
